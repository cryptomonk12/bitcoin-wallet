Building Mac OS binaries
========================

This guide explains how to build Electrum binaries for macOS systems.
We build our binaries on El Capitan (10.11.6) as building it on High Sierra
makes the binaries incompatible with older versions.


## 1. Run the script



    ./make_osx

## 2. Done

Hopefully it will be that simple.
