Electrum - a lightweight Bitcoin client and its server

Licence: GNU GPL v3
Author: thomasv1@gmx.de
Language: Python

Main features:

Client:
 * The client uses a deterministic wallet; if the wallet is lost, it can be recovered from its passphrase.
 * The client does not download the Bitcoin blockchain; it requests that information from the server
 * The client does not send its private keyes to the server.
 * The client does not need to open a port, it simply polls the server for updates.

Server:
 * The server uses a patched version of the Bitcoin daemon that can forward transactions, and bitcoin-abe
 * The server code is open source. Anyone can run a server, removing single points of failure concerns.
 * The server knows which set of Bitcoin addresses belong to the same wallet, which might raise concerns about anonymity. 
However, it should be possible to write clients capable of using several servers.
