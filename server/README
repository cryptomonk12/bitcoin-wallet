Electrum - server for the Electrum client

Licence: GNU GPL v3
Author: thomasv@gitorious
Language: Python

Features: 

* The server uses a patched version of the Bitcoin daemon that can
forward transactions, and bitcoin-abe * The server code is open
source. Anyone can run a server, removing single points of failure
concerns.

* The server knows which set of Bitcoin addresses belong to the same
wallet, which might raise concerns about anonymity. However, it should
be possible to write clients capable of using several servers.
