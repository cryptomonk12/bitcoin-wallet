Electrum - server for the Electrum client

Licence: GNU GPL v3
Author: thomasv@gitorious
Language: Python

Features: 

* The server uses a patched version of the Bitcoin daemon that can
forward transactions, and bitcoin-abe 

* The server code is open source. Anyone can run a server, removing
single points of failure concerns.

* The server knows which set of Bitcoin addresses belong to the same
wallet, which might raise concerns about anonymity. However, it should
be possible to write clients capable of using several servers.


INSTALL

1. patch and recompile the bitcoin daemon: see bitcoinrpc.cpp.diff and main.cpp.diff

2. install bitcoin-abe : https://github.com/jtobey/bitcoin-abe

3. install jsonrpclib: code.google.com/p/jsonrpclib/

4. launch the server:  nohup python -u server.py > /var/log/electrum.log &


Note: 
You do not want to run bitcoin-abe and the server simultaneously, because they will both try to update the database. 
If you want bitcoin-abe to be available on your website, run it with the --no-update option
