Licence: GNU GPL v3

Features:

* Encrypted wallet: the file that contains your bitcoins is protected with a password. You are protected from thieves.
* Deterministic key generation: If you lose your wallet, you can recover it from its seed. You are protected from your own mistakes.
* No blockchain download: the client requests blockchain information from a server. No delays, always up-to-date.
* Transactions are signed locally: Your private keys are not shared with the server. You do not have to trust the server with your money.
* Privacy: The server does not know you, it does not store user accounts. You are not tied to a particular server.
* No single point of failure: The server code is open source, anyone can run a server.
* Firewall friendly: The client does not need to open a port, it simply polls the server for updates.
* Open Source: Anyone can audit the code.
* Python. Very compact code, easy to contribute.
