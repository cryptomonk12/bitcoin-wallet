Version 0.34
------------

The key derivation was changed again in version 0.34, in order to
offer "type 2 wallet" capabilities. If you use an older wallet, you
will need to create a new wallet and move your coins. The procedure is
described below (version 0.31).


Version 0.31
------------

version 0.31 fixes a vulnerability in the key generation function.
Unfortunately, this means that wallets created prior to 0.31 are
incompatible with newer versions. We apologize for the
inconvenience. We try to keep this kind of upgrades as rare as
possible.

If you use an older wallet, you will see a message asking you to
create a new wallet and to move your balance to the new wallet.

Here are the steps that you need to follow:
* create a new wallet: electrum.py -w my_new_wallet.dat
* copy a receiving address from the new wallet
* open your old wallet: 
* move your entire balance to the new address.

Note that you may keep your current seed. For this, all you need to do
is to create the new wallet using the wallet recovery procedure. You
will not recover your old wallet with the new software, but you will
get a new wallet instead.
