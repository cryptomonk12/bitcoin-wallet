# Release 1.7

* Synchronization waits until transactions have 2 confirmations before
creating new addresses. This makes recovery from seed more robust, but
it might create unwanted gaps if you use Electrum 1.7 together with
older versions of Electrum.

* The Wall has been replaced by an interactive Python console. Wallet
and Blockchain functions can be accessed through it. The goal is to
let users extend Electrum through custom scripts. 

* New menu item to display the private key corresponding to a
receiving address.

* Added the ability to export your private keys through the classic GUI.
